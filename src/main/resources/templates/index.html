                <h1 class="mt-4">SDG-OD linker</h1>

                <p>SDG-OD is a Web application that was born from the following assumption: <i>If there are so many data sets around the world that contain information from a wide range of subjects, there must be some of them that can help measure and achieve the
                    <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/">Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)</a> proposed by the United Nations.</i></p>
                <p>The purpose of this application is to provide a platform in which anyone can find data related to many of the Sustainable Development Goals easily. Additionally, there's helpful information generated by the application that helps understand it's purpose further.</p>

                <p>This work leverages technologies provided by <a
                        href="https://www-sop.inria.fr/acacia/cours/essi2006/Scientific%20American_%20Feature%20Article_%20The%20Semantic%20Web_%20May%202001.pdf">The Semantic Web</a>. With the purpose of achieving our goal of connecting Open Data and the Sustainable Development Goals, we established the following architecture and implemented it within this application.
                </p>

                <img class="card-img" th:src="@{assets/img/architecture.png}" alt="Open Data and Sustainable Development Goals integration architecture">

                <p>Our methodology consists of four separate stages. Extracting Open Data from public access data portals, transforming such data, semantically annotate the Sustainable Development Goals to link them with related data sets, and visualizing the results.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-3">Open Data Extraction</h2>

                <p>In this first stage, the application extracts data sets from public access data portals that use the
                    <a href="https://ckan.org/">CKAN platform</a>. Doing so helps to maintain a standardized extraction method across many different sources. Many different organizations and governments use this platform to publish their data.
                    <a href="http://ambar.utpl.edu.ec/">√Åmbar UTPL</a>, the <a href="https://opendata.swiss/">Swiss government</a>, the
                    <a href="https://data.gov.au/">Australian Government</a>, the <a href="http://data.europa.eu/euodp/data/">EU Open Data Portal</a>, and the
                    <a href="https://data.humdata.org/">Humanitarian Data exchange</a> are amongst the platforms used in the testing phase of this application. The application then stores some of the data locally to use it in the next stage.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-3">Data transformation</h2>

                <p>This stage does some pre-processing to clean the extracted data sets and homogenize them as much as possible. Afterward, the application uses the semantic vocabulary
                    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/">DCAT</a> to create a knowledge representation from the data sets and upload a graph into a triplestore.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-3">SDG semantic annotation</h2>

                <p>Because the data from each Sustainable Development Goal is not machine-readable, the application uses Natural Language Processing to obtain a meaningful representation of each goal, target, and indicator. This process was accomplished by using the tool
                    <a href="http://wit.istc.cnr.it/stlab-tools/fred/#">FRED</a> that creates a formal semantic graph from natural language. The resulting graphs from FRED are then transformed into a concept taxonomy using the
                    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/">SKOS</a> vocabulary. Finally, the application uses the previously transformed data sets along with the concept taxonomy from each SDG to discover links between them. </p>

                <h2 class="mt-3">OD and SDG Visualizer</h2>

                <p>At this point, the application has created a semantic representation of the extracted data sets, the Sustainable Development Goals, and relationships between them. This web page offers different ways to visualize such data. Every data set can be seen and queried using the
                    <a th:href="@{/datasets}">data sets browser</a>. After accessing a particular data set, the application will display if it has any relationship with any of the 17 SDG. There is another
                    <a th:href="@{/sdg/datasets}">browser</a> that displays only the data sets that have relationships with one or more goals. Information about the SDG representation can be found on
                    <a th:href="@{/sdg/overview}">this page</a> as well.</p>
